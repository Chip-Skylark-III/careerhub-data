# Library Performance Indicators Dataset

Compilation of performance metrics for the Boulder Public Library such as circulation and holds of library materials, public use computer sessions, new cardholders, attendance at library and BLDG 61 events and programs, door counts, outreach efforts, and volunteer hours. The data is broken down by performance indicator, month, and library branch.

Branches labeled 'System' and 'BPL' indicate performance metrics for the entire Boulder Public Library. Blank cells for the 'Quantity' variable indicate data was never collected for that particular time period and indicator.

See library-performance-indicators-data-dictionary.csv for details of the performance indicators.
